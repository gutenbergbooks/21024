<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he birth of an heir to the throne
is usually accompanied by circumstances
befitting so great
an event. No place is deemed
worthy of it but a royal palace; and there,
at the approach of the expected hour, high
nobles and the great officers of state assemble,
while the whole country, big with
hope, waits to welcome a successor to its
long line of kings. Cannons announce
the event; seaward, landward, guns flash
and roar from floating batteries and rocky
battlements; bonfires blaze on hill-tops;
steeples ring out the news in merry peals;
the nation holds holiday, giving itself up
to banqueting and enjoyments, while
public prayers and thanksgivings rise to
Him by whom kings reign and princes
decree justice. With such pomp and
parade do the heirs of earthly thrones
enter on the stage of life! So came not
He who is the King of kings and Lord
of lords. On the eve of His birth the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
world went on its usual round. None
were moved for His coming; nor was
there any preparation for the event&mdash;a
chamber, or anything else. No fruit of
unhallowed love, no houseless beggar&#8217;s
child enters life more obscurely than the
Son of God. The very tokens by which
the shepherds were taught to recognise
Him were not the majesty but the extreme
meanness of his condition: &ldquo;This
shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find
the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,
lying in a manger.&rdquo; In fact, the Lord of
heaven was to be recognised by his
humiliation, as its heirs are by their humility.
Yet, as we have seen a black and
lowering cloud have its edges touched
with living gold by the sun behind it, so
all the darkest scenes of our Lord&#8217;s life
appear more or less irradiated with the
splendours of a strange glory. Take that
night on Galilee when a storm roared over
land and lake, enough to wake all but the
dead. The boat with Jesus and His disciples
tears through the waves, now whirling
on their foaming crests, now plunging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
into their yawning hollows; the winds
rave in His ear; the spray falls in cold
showers on His naked face; but He
sleeps. I have read of a soldier boy who
was found buried in sleep beneath his
gun, amid the cries and carnage of the
battle; and the powers of nature in our
Lord seem to be equally exhausted. His
strength is spent with toil; and with wan
face and wasted form He lies stretched
out on some rude boards&mdash;the picture of
one whose candle is burning away all too
fast, and whom excess of zeal is hurrying
into premature old age and an untimely
grave. Was the sight such as to suggest
the question, Where is now thy God?&mdash;how
soon it changed into a scene of magnificence
and omnipotent power! He
wakes&mdash;as a mother, whom louder sounds
would not stir, to her infant&#8217;s feeblest
wail, He wakes to the cry of His alarmed
disciples; and standing up, with the lightning
flash illumining His calm, divine
face, He looks out on the terrific war of
elements. He speaks; and all is hushed.
Obedient to His will, the winds fold their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
wings, the waves sink to rest; and there
is a great calm. &ldquo;Glory to God in the
highest!&rdquo; How may His people catch
up and continue the strain which falls
from angels&#8217; lips? In disciples plucked
from the very jaws of death, and pulling
their boat shoreward with strong hands
and happy hearts over a moonlit glassy
sea, Jesus shows us how He will make
good these sayings, &ldquo;Fear not, for I am
with thee; be not afraid, for I am thy
God&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have given unto them eternal
life, and they shall never perish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The divine glory of that scene is not
peculiar to it. For as an eagle, so soon
as she has stooped from her realm to the
ground, mounts aloft again, soaring into
the blue skies of her native heavens, our
Lord never descends into the abasement
of His meanest circumstances without
some act which bespeaks divinity, and
bears Him up before our eyes into the
regions of Godhead. The grave, where
He weeps like a woman, gives up its
prisoner at His word. Athirst by Jacob&#8217;s
well, like any other wayfaring, way-worn
traveller, He begs a draught of water from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a woman there, but tells her all she ever
did. Houseless and poor, His banquet
hall is the open air, His table the green
grass, His feast five barley loaves and
a few fishes from the neighbouring lake,
yet this scanty fare supplies the wants of
five thousand guests. His birth and life
and death, His whole history, in fact, resembles
one of those treasure-chests which
double locks secure; for as that iron safe
yields its hoards of gold, silver, pearls, and
precious stones to none but Him who
brings to each lock its own appropriate
key, so the riches of divine truth, redeeming
love, and saving mercy are open only
to such as come to Jesus with a belief in
His divinity on the one hand, and a belief
in His humanity on the other;&mdash;who
behold in the child, whose birth was sung
by angels, the son of Mary, and worship
the only begotten, well beloved, and
eternal Son of God.</p>

<p>Now this mingling of divine and human
characters distinguished Christ&#8217;s birth as
much as His death. The halo of glory
that surrounded His dying, crowned His
infant head. His sun rose, as it afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
set, behind a heavy bank of clouds;
but the divinity they screened, touched
their edges alike with burning gold; so
that He at whose death the rocks were
rent, and the sun eclipsed, and graves
deserted of their dead, no more entered
than He left our world as a common son
of Adam. Not that a world which was
to reject Him went out to meet its King
with homage and royal honours. Omen
of coming events, it received Him in sullen
silence. But the heavens declared His
glory, the skies sent out a sound; and
the tokens of His first advent&mdash;unlike the
thunders which shall rend the skies when
He comes the second time to judgment&mdash;were
all in beautiful harmony with its object.
It was love and saving mercy; there
were light, music, and angel forms. With
this object all things indeed were in perfect
keeping,&mdash;the serene night&mdash;the shining
stars&mdash;the pearly dews glistening on
the grass&mdash;snowy flocks safely pasturing&mdash;and
the shepherds themselves, to whom
the annunciation was made; men who,
whether going before their charge, or
carrying the lambs in their arms, or gently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
leading those that were with young, or
standing bravely between their flocks and
the roaring lion, were the choicest emblems
and types of Him who, dying to
save us, gave His life for the sheep. To
them there suddenly appeared a multitude
of the heavenly host, turning night into
day, and shedding on the soft hills around
a bright but gentle radiance. As guard
of honour, they had swept in their downward
flight by many a sun and star, escorting
the Son of God to our nether
world. And now&mdash;ere they left Him to
tread the wine-press alone, and returned
on upward wings to their native heavens,
and their service before the throne of God&mdash;these
celestials bent their loving eyes
on the stable; and in anticipation of
Jesus&#8217; triumphs, of men saved, death
conquered, graves spoiled, and Satan
crushed, they sang &ldquo;Glory to God in
the highest, and on earth peace, good
will toward men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This hymn, sung perhaps in parts by different
bands of these heavenly choristers
consists of three parts; and we now proceed
to the illustration of these.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<h3>THAT REDEMPTION YIELDS THE HIGHEST
GLORY TO GOD.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span> say the highest; for though His
<i>absolute</i> glory, like His eternal
being and infinite perfections,
admits of no degrees, and is
affected by no circumstances whatever, it
is otherwise with His <i>declarative</i> glory, as
old theologians called it. This, which I
speak of, and which angels sung of, consists
in the manifestation of His attributes.
Whatever it be, though only the drop of
water, which appears a world of wonders
to the eyes of a man of science, any work
is glorious which reflects the divine character
in any measure, and still more glorious
or glorifying which exhibits it in a
greater measure. God&#8217;s glory expands
and unfolds itself as we rise upward in
the study of His works&mdash;from inanimate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to living objects; from plants to animals;
from animals to man; from man to angels;
from these to archangels, upward and still
upward, to the Being who, bathed in the
full blaze of divine effulgence, tops the
pyramid, and stands on the highest pinnacle
of Creation. That Being is God
manifest in the flesh, our Lord Jesus
Christ&mdash;the redemption which He wrought
for us, through blood and suffering and
death, being the work which reveals God
most fully to our eyes, and forming a looking-glass,
so to speak, to reflect the whole
measure of divinity. This will appear if
we look at&mdash;</p>

<p>The Redeemer.&mdash;One of His many
titles is the <i>Wonderful</i>. Anticipating the
royal birth at Bethlehem, and speaking of
Christ in terms which no other key can
open but the doctrine of His divinity,
Isaiah says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born,
unto us a son is given; and the government
shall be upon his shoulder: and his
name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,
The mighty God, The everlasting
Father, The Prince of Peace.&rdquo; With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
pencils of sunlight God paints the rose;
by arts of a divine chemistry He turns
foul decay into the snow-white purity and
fragrant odours of a lily; He fashions the
infant in the darkness of the mother&#8217;s
womb; He inspires dead matter with the
active principle of life; in man He unites
an ethereal spirit to a lump of clay&mdash;wonders
these which have perplexed the
wisest men, and remain as incomprehensible
to philosophers as to fools. Yet, as
if there was no mystery in these but what
our understanding could fathom&mdash;as if
there was nothing in these to teach proud
man humility and rouse his admiration&mdash;as
if there was indeed no wonder but
Christ himself in all this great and glorious
universe, He is called by way of eminence
the <i>Wonderful</i>. And why? Because, as
the stars cease to shine in presence of the
sun, quenched by the effulgence, and
drowned in the flood of his brighter
beams, these lose all their wonders beside
this little Child. To a meditative man it
is curious to stand over any cradle where
an infant sleeps; and, as we look on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
face so calm, and the little arms gently
folded on the placid breast, to think of
the mighty powers and passions which are
slumbering there; to think that this feeble
nursling has heaven or hell before it; that
an immortal in a mortal form is allied to
angels; that the life which it has begun
shall last when the sun is quenched, enduring
throughout all eternity. Much
more wonderful the spectacle the manger
offers, where shepherds bend their knees,
and angels bend their eyes! Here is present,
not the immortal, but the eternal;
here is not one kind of matter united to
another, or a spiritual to an earthly element,
but the Creator to a creature, divine
Omnipotence to human weakness, the
Ancient of Days to the infant of a day.
What deep secrets of divine wisdom,
power, and love lie here, wrapped up in
these poor swaddling-clothes! Mary holds
in her arms, in this manger with its straw,
what draws the wondering eyes, and inspires
the loftiest songs of angels. If that
be not God&#8217;s greatest, and therefore most
glorifying work, where are we to seek it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in what else is it found? &ldquo;The depth
saith, It is not in me; and the sea saith,
It is not in me!&rdquo; Were we to range the
vast universe to find its rival, we should
return, like the dove to its ark, to the
stable-door, and the swaddled babe, there
to mingle human voices with the heavenly
choir&mdash;singing, Glory to God in the
highest!</p>

<p>The fact that redemption yields God
the highest glory will appear also if we
look at&mdash;</p>

<p>The Redeemed.&mdash;It is in them, in sinners
saved, not in the happy and holy
angels, that God stands out fully revealed
as in a mirror; long and broad enough, if
I may say so, to show forth all His attributes.
To vary the figure; the cross of
Christ is the focus in which all the beams
of divinity, all the attributes of the Godhead,
are gathered into one bright, burning
spot, with power to warm the coldest and
melt the stoniest heart. No man hath
seen God at any time, otherwise than in
His works; and though created things are
immeasurably inferior to their Creator,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they may still help us to form some conception
of His character. A drop of
water is an ocean, a spark of fire is a sun,
every grain of sand on the sea-shore is a
world, in miniature; and as those who
have never seen ocean, or sun, or world,
may form some idea of their appearance
by magnifying these their miniatures millions
of millions of times, so, by immensely
magnifying the age, the power, the wisdom,
the holiness of an angel, we could
form some dim conception of God. Not
that we would not have still to ask, &ldquo;Who
can by searching find out God? who can
find out the Almighty to perfection?&rdquo;&mdash;not
that when we had exclaimed, in the
sublime words of Job, &ldquo;Hell is naked
before him, and destruction hath no covering.
He stretcheth out the north over
the empty place, and hangeth the earth
on nothing. He bindeth up the waters
in his thick clouds. He holdeth back the
face of his throne. The pillars of heaven
tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
He divideth the sea with his power. By
his spirit he hath garnished the heavens;&rdquo;&mdash;we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
would not have to add with the
patriarch, &ldquo;These are parts of his ways;
but how little a portion is heard of him?
but the thunder of his power who can understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Study Him, for example, in the angels
who sung this birth-song! They are holy,
and we may conclude that their Maker is
infinitely holy; they are wise, and He
who made them must possess infinite wisdom;
they are powerful, and He must be
omnipotent; the God of good angels must
be infinitely good, as the avenger of sin
and evil ones must be infinitely just. This
is sound reasoning&mdash;for, as David says,
&ldquo;He that planted the ear, shall he not
hear? He that formed the eye, shall he
not see? He that chastiseth the heathen,
shall not he correct? He that teacheth
man knowledge, shall not he know?&rdquo;
Still, however lofty and worthy were the
conceptions which we thus formed of
God, He had never been discovered in
the full glory of His gracious character by
this or any corresponding process. Unspeakable
honour to man and unspeakable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
grace in God, the fulness of His character
is revealed, not by seraphs but by saints&mdash;in
redeemed and ransomed sinners. And
so Mary Magdalene, as reflecting His attributes
more fully than angels, wears in
heaven a brighter glory than crowns their
unfallen heads. She, and all with her,
who have washed their robes in the blood
of the Lamb, are trophies of free, saving
mercy; monuments of that love which,
when stern justice had dragged us to the
mouth of the pit, and angels, who had seen
their fellows punished by one awful act of
vengeance, stood in dread and silent expectation
of another, graciously interposed,
saying, &ldquo;Deliver from going down to the
pit, I have found a ransom.&rdquo; Then, blessed
Son of God, thou didst step forward to
say, And I am that ransom! From that
day heaven was happier. It found a new
joy. Angels tuned their golden harps to
higher strains; and now, these blessed
spirits, above the mean jealousies of earth&#8217;s
elder brothers, whenever they see Christ
born anew in a soul&mdash;a sinner born again,
called, converted, apparelled in Jesus&#8217;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
righteousness, rejoicing in His arms, or
even weeping at His feet, wake up the
old, grand birth-song, singing, &ldquo;Glory to
God in the highest!&rdquo; &ldquo;There is joy,&rdquo; said
Jesus, &ldquo;in the presence of the angels of
God over one sinner that repenteth&mdash;joy
shall be in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth, more than over ninety and nine
just persons, which need no repentance.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="dropcapn"><span class="dropcap">N</span></span>o man hath seen God at any
time; so saith the Scriptures.
He who is confined to no
bounds of space cannot in the
nature of things have any visible form.
God has however occasionally made revelations
of Himself; and such are described
in language which seems opposed
alike to the declarations of Scripture and
the deductions of reason. It is said, for
instance, of Moses and Aaron, when they
ascended Mount Sinai, that &ldquo;they saw
the God of Israel;&rdquo; and Isaiah tells how
he &ldquo;saw the Lord sitting upon a throne,
high and lifted up, and his train filled the
temple.&rdquo; Believing with the Jews that if
any man saw God he could not survive,
but would die as by a flash of lightning,
the prophet was struck with terror, and
cried, in expectation of immediate death,
&ldquo;I am undone; for mine eyes have seen
the Lord of hosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The object seen in these and also other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
cases was no doubt the Schekinah&mdash;that
holy and mysterious flame whereby God
made His presence known in the days of
old. We know little concerning it beyond
this, that it was of the nature of light. The
fairest, purest, oldest of created things,
passing untainted through pollution, turning
gloomy night into day, and imparting
their varied beauties to earth and air and
ocean, this of all material elements was
the fittest symbol of God. A circumstance
this to which we probably owe the
ancient practice of worshipping the Divinity
by fire, and certainly such figures as
these: &ldquo;God is light;&rdquo; &ldquo;He clothes
himself with light as with a garment;&rdquo;
&ldquo;He dwelleth in light that is inaccessible
and full of glory.&rdquo; This light, said to
have been intensely luminous, brighter
than a hundred suns, was not always nor
even usually visible; although, like a lamp
placed behind a curtain, it may have
usually imparted to the cloud which concealed
it a tempered and dusky glow.
There were occasions when the veil of
this temple was rent asunder; and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the light shone out with intense splendour&mdash;dazzling
all eyes, and convincing
sceptics that this cloud, now resting on
the tabernacle, and now, signal for the
host to march, floating upward in the
morning air, was not akin to such as are
born of swamps or sea; and which, as
emblems of our mortality, after changing
from rosy beauty into leaden dullness,
melt into air, leaving the place that once
knew them to know them no more for
ever. This symbol and token of the Divine
presence was of all the types and
figures of Jesus Christ in some respects
both the most apposite and glorious: a
cloud with God within, and speaking from
it&mdash;going before to guide the host&mdash;placing
Himself for their protection between
them and their enemies&mdash;by day their
grateful shade from scorching heat, by
night their sun amid surrounding darkness.</p>

<p>It was one, and not the least singular
of its aspects, that this cloud always grew
light when the world grew dark&mdash;the
cloudy pillar of the day blazing forth at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
night as a pillar of fire. So shone the
divinity in Him who was &ldquo;Emmanuel,
God with us,&rdquo; His darkest circumstances,
His deepest humiliations, being the occasions
of His greatest glory. He was
buried, and being so, was greatly humbled;
but angels attended His funeral, and
guarded His tomb. He was crucified,
condemned to the death of the vilest
criminal, and being so, was greatly humbled;
but those heavens and earth which
are as little moved by the death of the
greatest monarch as by the fall of a withered
leaf, expressed their sympathy with
the august Sufferer&mdash;the sun hid his face,
and went into mourning, the earth trembled
with horror at the deed. He was
born, and in like manner He was greatly
humbled, and had been, though His birth
had happened in a palace and His mother
had been a queen; but with a poor woman
for His mother, a stable for His birthplace,
a manger for His cradle, and straw
for His bed, these meannesses, like its spots
on the face of the sun, were lost in a blaze
of glory. Earth did not celebrate His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
advent, but Heaven did. Illumining her
skies, she sent herald angels to proclaim
the news, and lighted up a new star to
guide the feet which sought the place
where man&#8217;s best hopes were cradled.
The most joyful birth that ever happened,
it was meet that it should be sung by
angel lips,&mdash;and all the more because,
redemption glorifies God in the sight of
holy angels.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<h3>REDEMPTION GLORIFIES GOD IN THE SIGHT
OF HOLY ANGELS.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>hey take a lively interest in the
affairs of our world, as the Scriptures
show, and as Jacob saw in
his vision; for what else means
that ladder where they appeared to his
dreaming eye ascending and descending
between earth and heaven? To the care
of John our dying Lord committed his
mother; but God, when He sent His Son
into the world, committed Him to their
care,&mdash;&ldquo;He hath given his angels charge
over thee, that thou dash not thy foot
against a stone.&rdquo; The care which their
Head enjoyed is extended to all the members.
How happy are the people that are
in such a case! Think of the poor saint
who has none to wait on him, or the pious
domestic who serves a table, and humbly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
waits on others, having angels to wait on
her! Are they not said in Scripture to be
&ldquo;ministering spirits sent forth to minister
to them who are heirs of salvation?&rdquo;&mdash;however
the world may despise them,
&ldquo;this honour have all his saints.&rdquo; However
lowly their earthly state, the saints
are a kingly race; and as our highest
nobles deem it an honour to wait on the
princes of the blood, accepting and soliciting
offices at court, the angels are happy
to serve such as, through their union with
His incarnate Son, stand nearer the throne
of God than themselves. Unseen by him,
these celestials guard the good man&#8217;s bed;
watch his progress; wait on his person;
guide his steps; and ward off many a blow
the devil aims at his head and heart. They
are the nurses of Christ&#8217;s babes; the tutors
and teachers of His children. A belief in
guardian saints is a silly Popish superstition;
but we have good authority in Scripture
for believing that in this our state of
pupilage and probation, along all the way
to Sion, in the conflicts with temptation,
and amid the thick of battle, God commits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
His saints to angels&#8217; care; and that, as it
is in their loving arms that the soul of an
aged saint is borne away to glory, every
child of God has its own celestial guardian,
and sleeps in its little cradle beneath the
feathers of an angel&#8217;s wing. What said
our Lord? On setting a child before the
people as a pattern for them to copy,
&ldquo;Take heed,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;that ye despise
not one of these little ones; for I say unto
you, That in heaven their angels do always
behold the face of my Father which is in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But whether we are, or are not, the
happier for angels, there is no question
that they are the happier for us. They
always loved God; but since man&#8217;s redemption
they love Him more, and employ
higher strains and loftier raptures to praise
His wisdom, power, holiness, justice, and
love. It has disclosed to them new views
of God, and opened up in heaven new
springs of pleasure. Heaven has grown
more heavenly, and though they might
have deemed it impossible to add one
drop to their happiness, they are holier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and happier angels. There is joy among
the angels of heaven over every sinner
that repenteth; and to the joyful cry, My
son that was dead is alive again, they
respond, as they receive the returned penitent
from the Father&#8217;s arms into their own,
My brother that was dead is alive again,
that was lost is found! Never from surf-beaten
shore or rocky headland do spectators
watch with such anxious interest
the life-boat, as, now seen and now lost,
now breasting the waves and now hurled
back on the foaming crest of a giant billow,
she makes for the wreck, as they watch
those who, with the Bible in their hearts
and hands, go forth to save the lost. And
when the poor perishing sinner throws
himself into Jesus&#8217; arms, what gratulations
among these happy spirits! &ldquo;There is
joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,
more than over ninety and nine just
persons.&rdquo; The event is one which I can
fancy was in the prophet&#8217;s eye, when, fired
with rapture, he cried, &ldquo;Sing, O ye heavens;
for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye lower
parts of the earth; break forth into singing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
ye mountains, O forest, and every tree
therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob,
and glorified himself in Israel!&rdquo; And the
heavens do sing. While the saints, descending
from their thrones, cast their
sparkling crowns at Jesus&#8217; feet, and ten
times ten thousand harps sound, and ten
times ten thousand angels sing, &ldquo;Worthy
is the Lamb that was slain to receive power,
and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
honour, and glory, and blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<h3>REDEMPTION GLORIFIES GOD THROUGHOUT
ALL THE UNIVERSE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>ith a small band of fishermen
at His side, and no place on
earth where to lay His head,
Jesus pointed to the sun, riding
high in heaven or rising over the hill-tops
to bathe the scene in golden splendour,
and said, &ldquo;I am the Light of the world.&rdquo;
A bold saying; yet the day is coming, however
distant it appears, when the tidings
of salvation carried to the ends of the
earth, and Jesus worshipped of all nations,
shall justify the speech; and the wishes
shall be gratified, and the prayers answered,
and the prophecies fulfilled, so beautifully
expressed in these lines of Heber:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,</span><br />
<span class="i1">And you, ye waters, roll,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till, like a sea of glory,</span><br />
<span class="i1">It spreads from pole to pole.&rdquo;</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
But shall our world be the limits of the
wondrous tale? Though ever and deeply
interesting as the scene of redemption,
just as to patriots is the barest moor where
a people fought and conquered for their
freedom, our earth holds in other respects
but a very insignificant place in creation.
In a space of the sky no larger than a
tenth part of the moon&#8217;s disc, the telescope
discovers many thousands of stars, each a
sun, attended probably by a group of
planets like our own: their number indeed
is such that many parts of the heavens
appear as if they were sprinkled with gold-dust;
and probably there are as many
suns and worlds in the universe as there
are leaves in a forest, or rather, sands on
the ocean shore.</p>

<p>Boldly venturing out into the regions of
speculation, some have thought that, if
sin defile any of these worlds, its inhabitants
may share in the benefits of the
atonement which Christ offered in ours;
and that beings further removed than we
from the scenes of Calvary, and differing
more from us than we from the Jews of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
whom the Messiah came, may, as well as
we, find a Saviour by faith in Jesus; and
that for this end the work of redemption
has perhaps been revealed to such as, removed
from our earth many millions of
miles, never even saw the planet that was
its theatre and scene. There may be
nothing in this. I dare not say it is impossible;
but these speculations touch the
deep things of God, and we would not
attempt to be wise above that which is
written. Still, Scripture affords ground
for believing, for hoping, at least, that the
story of redemption has been told in other
worlds than ours, and that the love of God
in Christ&mdash;that fairest, fullest manifestation
of our Father&#8217;s heart&mdash;links all parts
of creation together, and links all more
closely to the throne of God. &ldquo;He that
hath seen me, Philip,&rdquo; said our Lord to
that disciple, &ldquo;hath seen the Father also;&rdquo;
and as I believe that He who delights to
bless all His unfallen creatures would not
withhold from the inhabitants of other
spheres the happiness of knowing Him in
His most adorable, gracious, and glorious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
character, I can fancy them eagerly searching
their skies for a sight of our world,&mdash;the
scene of that story which has conveyed
to them the fullest knowledge of
Him they love, their deepest sense of His
ineffable holiness and unspeakable mercy.
Not from pole to pole, but from planet to
planet, and from star to star, the love of
Christ deserves to be proclaimed; and it
is a thought as grand as it is probable, that
the story of Calvary, not yet translated
into all the tongues of earth, is told in the
ten times ten thousand tongues of other
worlds, and that the Name which is above
every name&mdash;the blessed Name which
dwells in life in a believer&#8217;s heart and
trembles in death on his lips&mdash;is known
in spheres which his foot never trod and
his eye never saw. Such honours crown
the head man once crowned with thorns;
and therefore did David, with the eye of
a seer and the fire of a poet, while calling
for praise from kings of the earth and all
people, princes and all judges, young men
and children, rise to a loftier flight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
exclaiming: &ldquo;Praise Him in the heights.
Praise ye Him, all ye angels: praise ye
Him, all His hosts. Praise ye Him, sun
and moon: praise Him, all ye stars of
light.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h2>IV.</h2>

<h3>THE REDEEMER AND REDEMPTION ARE
WORTHY OF OUR HIGHEST PRAISE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapl"><span class="dropcap">L</span></span>et us bend the head, and, in
company of the shepherds, enter
the stable. Heard above the
champing of bits, the stroke of
hoofs, the rattling of chains, and the lowing
of oxen, the feeble wail of an infant
turns our steps to a particular stall: here
a woman lies stretched on a bed of straw,
and her new-born child, hastily wrapped
in some part of her dress, finds a cradle
in the manger. A pitiful sight!&mdash;such a
fortune as occasionally befalls the Arabs
of society&mdash;such an incident as may occur
in the history of one of those vagrant,
vagabond, outcast families who, their
country&#8217;s shame, tent in woods and sleep
under hedges, when no barn or stable
offers a covering to their houseless heads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Yet princes on their way to the crown,
brides on their way to the marriage, bannered
armies on their way to the battle,
and highest angels in their flight from star
to star, might stop to say of this sight, as
Moses of the burning bush, &ldquo;Let me turn
aside, and see this great sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prophet foretells a time when the
wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard shall lie down with the kid; and,
bound in the same stall, and fed at the
same manger, the lion shall eat straw with
the ox. Here is a greater wonder! This
stable is the house of God, the very gate
of heaven: under this dusty roof, inside
those narrow walls, He lodges whom the
heaven of heavens cannot contain: the
tenant of this manger is the Son, who,
leaving the bosom of His Father to save
us, here pillows His head on straw; of
this feeble babe the hands are to hurl
Satan from his throne, and wrench asunder
the strong bars of death; this one tender
life, this single corn-seed is to become the
prolific parent of a thousand harvests, and
fill the garners of glory with the fruits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
salvation. Mean as it looks, yet more
splendid than marble palaces,&mdash;more
sacred than the most venerable and hallowed
temples, here the Son of God was
born, and with Him were born Faith,
Hope, and Charity&mdash;our Peace, our
Liberty, and our Eternal Life. Had He
not been born, we had never been born
again; had He not lain in a manger, we
had never lain in Abraham&#8217;s bosom;
had He not been wrapped in swaddling-clothes,
we had been wrapped in everlasting
flames; had His head in infancy not been
pillowed on straw, and in death on thorns,
ours had never been crowned in glory.
But that He was born, better we had
never been; life had been a misfortune to
which time had brought no change, and
death no relief, and the grave no rest.
&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest&rdquo; that He
was born: we had otherwise been lifting
up our eyes in torment with this unavailing,
endless cry, &ldquo;O that my mother had been
my grave! Cursed be the day wherein I
was born?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If language cannot express the love and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
gratitude we owe to the Saviour, let our
lives do so. Shallow streams run brawling
over their pebbly beds, but the broad,
deep river pursues its course in silence to
the sea; and so is it with our strongest,
deepest feelings. Great joy like great
sorrow, great gladness like great grief,
great admiration like great detestation,
take breath and speech away. On first
seeing Mont Blanc as the sun rose to
light up his summit and irradiate another
and another snow-clad pinnacle, I remember
the silent group who had left their
couches to witness and watch the glorious
scene: before its majesty and magnificence
all were for awhile dumb, opening
not the mouth. I have read, when travellers
reached the crest of the hill, and first
looked down on Jerusalem,&mdash;the scene of
our Saviour&#8217;s sorrow, the garden that
heard His groans, the city that led Him
out to die, the soil that was bedewed with
His tears and crimsoned with His blood,&mdash;how
their hearts were too full for utterance.
If a sight of the city where He
died so affects Christians, as the scenes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of His last hours rush on their memory
and rise vividly to their imagination, how
will they look on that scene where, surrounded
by ten times ten thousand saints
and thousands of angels, He reigns in
glory! I can fancy the saint who has
shut his eyes on earth to open them in
heaven, standing speechless; and as the
flood of music fills his ear, and the blaze
of glory his eye, and the thought of what
he owes to Jesus his heart,&mdash;I can fancy
him laying the crown, which he has received
from his Saviour&#8217;s hands, in silent
gratitude at His feet; and as he recovers
speech, and sees hell and its torments
beneath him, earth and its sorrows behind
him, an eternity of unchequered, unchanging
bliss, before him,&mdash;I can fancy
the first words that break from his grateful
lips will be, &ldquo;Glory to God, glory to
God in the highest!&rdquo; Never till then,
nowhere but there, will our praise be
worthy of Jesus and His redemption.
Meanwhile, let Him who demonstrates
God&#8217;s highest glory and fills heaven&#8217;s
highest throne, hold the highest place in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
our hearts. Let us surround His name
with the highest honours; and, laying our
time and talents, our faculties and our
affections, our wealth, and fame, and
fortunes at His feet, crown Him Lord of
all.</p>

<span class="dropcaps"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>ome years ago the question
which agitated the heart of
Europe was, Peace or War?
The interests of commerce, the
lives of thousands, the fate of kingdoms,
trembled in the balance. Navies rode at
anchor, and opposing armies, like two
black thunder-clouds, waited for statesmen
to issue from the council-chamber,
bearing the sword or the olive-branch.
Esteeming the arbitrament of battle one
which necessity only could justify, Britain
longed for peace; but, with ships ready
to slip their cables, and soldiers standing
by their guns, she was grimly prepared
for war. Had ambassadors from the nation
with which we were ready to join
issue approached our shores at this crisis,
what eager crowds would have attended
their advent, and how impatiently would
they have waited the course of events!
And had peace been the result of the
conference, how would the tidings, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
they passed from mouth to mouth, and
were flashed by the telegraph from town
to town, have filled and moved the land!
The pale student would have forgot his
books, the anxious merchant his speculations,
the trader his shop, the tradesman
his craft, tired labour her toils, happy children
their toys, and even the bereaved
their griefs; and like the whirlpool, which
sucks straws and sea-weed, boats and gallant
ships&mdash;all things, big or small&mdash;into
its mighty vortex, the news would have
absorbed all other subjects. The one
topic of conversation at churches and
theatres, at marriages and funerals, in
halls and cottages, in crowded cities and
in lonely glens; ministers had carried it
in their sermons to the pulpit, and devout
Christians in their thanksgivings to the
Throne of Grace.</p>

<p>In a much greater crisis, where the
stakes were deeper, the question being
not one of peace or war between man
and man, but between man and God, an
embassy from heaven reached the borders
of our world. Unlike Elijah, rough in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
dress, of aspect stern and speech severe,
whose appearance struck Ahab with terror,
and wrung from the pale lips of the conscience-stricken
king the cry, &ldquo;Hast thou
found me, O mine enemy?&rdquo;&mdash;unlike Jonah
as he walked the wondering streets, and
woke their echoes with his doleful cry,
&ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
destroyed,&rdquo;&mdash;the ambassadors were &ldquo;a
multitude of shining angels.&rdquo; Leaving
the gates of heaven, they winged their
flight down the starry sky to descend and
hover above the fields of Bethlehem, and
in the form of a song, as became such
joyful tidings, to proclaim news of Peace&mdash;their
song, &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest,
on earth peace, good-will toward men.&rdquo;
Nothing presents a more remarkable example
of &ldquo;much in little&rdquo; than these few
but weighty words. In small crystals,
that coat, as with shining frost-work, the
sides of a vessel, we have all the salts
which give perpetual freshness to the
ocean, their life to the weeds that clothe
its rocks, and to the fish that swim its
depths and shallows. In some drops of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
oil distilled from rose-leaves of Indian
lands, and valued at many times their
weight in gold, we have enclosed within
one small phial the perfume of a whole
field of roses&mdash;that which, diffused through
ten thousand leaves, gave every flower its
fragrance. Essences, as they are called,
present, in a concentrated form, the peculiar
properties of leaves or flowers or
fruits, of the animal, vegetable, or earthly
bodies from which they are extracted; and,
like these, this hymn presents the whole
gospel in a single sentence. Here is the
Bible, the scheme of redeeming love, that
grand work which saved a lost world,
gladdened angels in heaven, confounded
devils in hell, and engaged the highest
attributes of the Godhead, summed up in
one short, glorious, glowing paragraph.
For what so much as the gospel, what, indeed,
but the gospel, yields Jehovah the
highest glory, blesses our earth with peace,
and expresses Heaven&#8217;s good-will to the
sons of men? Such were the ambassadors,
and such the embassage!</p>

<p>When the king of Babylon, hearing how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the shadow had travelled back ten degrees
on the dial of Ahaz, sent ambassadors to
Hezekiah to inquire about this strange phenomenon,
Hezekiah received them with
the greatest respect; paid them honours, indeed,
which cost both him and his country
dear. The news of an embassy having
come to Joshua spread like wildfire among
the Israelites, moving the whole camp.
Seized with eager curiosity, all ran to hear
what the strangers had to say, and gaze
with wonder on their soiled and ragged
dress, their clouted shoes and mouldy
bread. The herald angels, though arrayed
in heavenly splendours, and bringing glad
tidings of peace, were received with no
such honours, excited no such interest.
Strange and sad omen of the indifference
with which many would hear the gospel!
While angels sung, the world slept; and
none but some wakeful watchers heard
their voices or beheld this splendid vision.
They were humble shepherds, to whom
the ambassadors of heaven delivered their
message; and it may be well to pause and
look at those who were privileged and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
honoured to hear it. We do not pretend
to know certainly the reasons why God,
who giveth no account of His ways, conferred
an honour so distinguished on them
rather than on others. But we may guess;
and in any case may find the employment
profitable and instructive, if we are wise
enough to find &ldquo;sermons in stones, books
in the running brooks, and good in everything.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<h3>THEY WERE MEN OF A PEACEFUL CALLING.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he highest view of the profession
of arms is, that the soldier, deterring
evil-doers and maintaining
order at home, on the one
hand, and prepared, on the other, to resist
hostile invasion, is in reality, notwithstanding
his deadly weapons and warlike garb,
an officer or instrument of peace. A day
is coming&mdash;alas! with the roar of cannon
booming across the ocean, how far distant
it seems!&mdash;when Christianity shall exert
a paramount influence throughout all the
world: then, tyrants having ceased to
reign, and slaves to groan, and nations to
suffer from the lust of gold or power, this
beautiful picture of the prophet shall become
a reality: &ldquo;The whole earth,&rdquo; said
the seer, &ldquo;is at rest, and is quiet; they
break forth into singing.&rdquo; Till then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
paradoxical though it appears, the cause of
peace may be pled with most effect by the
mouths of cannon. Fitness for war is often
the strongest security for peace; and a
nation whose wishes and interests both run
in the direction of peace, may find no way
of warning restless and unprincipled and
ambitious neighbours that it is not to be
touched with impunity, but by showing
itself, thistle-like, all bristling over with
bayonets. &ldquo;Necessity,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;is
laid on me to preach.&rdquo; It may be laid on
a people to fight. Nor, when the sword
has been drawn in a good cause, has God
refused His sanction to that last, terrible
resort. It was He who imparted strength
to the arm before whose resistless sweep
the Philistines fell in swathes, like grass to
the mower&#8217;s scythe. It was He who guided
the stone that, shot from David&#8217;s sling,
buried itself in the giant&#8217;s brow. It was
He who gave its earthquake-power to the
blast of the horns which levelled the walls
of Jericho with the ground. And when
night came down to cover the retreat of
the Amorites and their allies, it was He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
who interposed to secure the bloody fruits
of victory&mdash;saying, as eloquently put by a
rustic preacher, &ldquo;&#8216;Fight on, my servant
Joshua, and I will hold the lights;&#8217; and
&#8216;the sun stood still on Gibeon, and the
moon in the valley of Ajalon.&#8217;&rdquo; Admitting
war to be an awful scourge, these cases
show that the duties of a soldier are not
inconsistent with the calling of a Christian.</p>

<p>Yet it was over no battle-field, the most
sacred to truth and liberty, these angels
hovered; no blazing homesteads nor
burning cities shed their lurid gleam on
the skies they made radiant with light;
nor was it where their sweet voices
strangely mingled with the clash of arms
and the shouts of charging squadrons that
they sang of glory, good-will, and peace.
This had been out of keeping with the
congruity which characterises all God&#8217;s
works of nature, and which will be found
equally characteristic of His works of
providence and grace. As was meet, the
glad tidings of peace were announced to
men who were engaged in an eminently
peaceful occupation; who passed tranquil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
lives amid the quietness of the solemn
hills, far removed alike from the ambitious
strife of cities and the bloody spectacles
of war. Lying amid the solitudes of the
mountains, where no sounds fall on the
ear but the bleating of flocks, the lowing
of cattle, the hum of bees, the baying of
a watch-dog from the lonely homestead,
the murmur of hidden rills, the everlasting
rush of the waterfall as it plunges flashing
into its dark, foaming pool, pastoral are
eminently peaceful scenes. Indeed, the
best emblem of peace which a great painter
has been able to present he owes to them&mdash;it
is a picture of a quiet glen, with a
lamb licking the rusty lips of a dismounted
gun, while the flocks around crop the grass
that waves above the slain.</p>

<p>Apt scholars of the devil, wicked men
have used Holy Scripture to justify the
most impious crimes. Others, with more
fancy than judgment, have drawn the most
absurd conclusions from its facts; but we
seem warranted to conclude, that by selecting
shepherds to receive the first tidings
of Jesus&#8217; birth, apart from the circumstance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
that they were Christ&#8217;s own favourite
types of Himself, God intended to
confer special honour on the cause, and
encourage the lovers and advocates of
peace. Deer are furnished by nature with
horns, dogs with teeth, eagles with talons,
serpents with poison, and bees with stings;
but men have no weapons of offence. Yet,
acting under the dominion of their lusts,
men have a passion for fighting, and, easily
fired with the spirit, and dazzled with the
glory of war, are ready to abandon arguments
for blows; and I cannot but think
that He who would not permit David, the
man after His own heart, to build Him a
house because he had been a man of
blood, conferred this honour on these
humble shepherds because they were men
of peace. Whether it be with Himself or
our own consciences, in the midst of our
families, among our neighbours, or between
nation and nation, He enjoins us to cultivate
peace: in His own emphatic words,
we are to &ldquo;seek peace and pursue it.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<h2>VI.</h2>

<h3>THEY WERE MEN OF HUMBLE RANK.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>any in humble, as well as in
more coveted circumstances,
are discontented with their
position. They repine at their
lot, and murmur against the Providence
which has assigned it. This is not only
wicked but absurd, since true happiness
lies much less in changing our condition
than in making the best of it, whatever it
be. Besides, God says, &ldquo;I will make a
man more precious than fine gold; even a
man than the golden wedge of Ophir;&rdquo; and
the estimate which He forms of us turns in
no respect whatever on the place we fill.
One artist paints a grand, another a common,
or even a mean, subject; but we
settle their comparative merits, praising
this one and condemning that, not by the
subjects they paint, but by the way they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
paint them. To borrow an illustration
from the stage, (as Paul did from heathen
games,) one player, tricked out in regal
state, with robes, and crown, and sceptre,
performs the part of a king, and another
that only of a common soldier or country
boor; yet the applause of the audience is
not given to the parts the actors play, but
to the way they play them. Even so, it
is not the place that man fills, whether
high or humble, but the way he fills it to
which God has, and we should have, most
regard.</p>

<p>Not that we would reduce the inequalities
of society any more than those of the
earth, with its varied features of swelling
hill and lovely dale, to one dull, long,
common level. Death, the great grim
leveller, does that office both for cottagers
and kings. Let it be left to the sexton&#8217;s
spade. The mountains which give shelter
to the valleys, and gather the rains that
fill their rivers and fertilise their pastures,
have important uses in nature, and so
have the corresponding heights of rank
and wealth and power in society. Setting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
our affections on things above, let us be
content to wait for the honours and rest
of heaven; let us seek to be good rather
than great; to be rich in faith rather than
in wealth; to stand high in God&#8217;s esteem
rather than in man&#8217;s; saying, with Paul,
&ldquo;I have learned in whatsoever state I am,
therewith to be content;&rdquo;&mdash;or singing
with the boy in the &ldquo;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress,&rdquo;
who, meanly clad, but with &ldquo;a fresh and
well-favoured countenance,&rdquo; fed his father&#8217;s
sheep,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;He that is down needs fear no fall;</span><br />
<span class="i1">He that is low, no pride;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He that is humble ever shall</span><br />
<span class="i1">Have God to be his guide.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I am content with what I have,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Little be it or much;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, Lord, contentment still I crave,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Because thou savest such.&rdquo;</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear him?&rdquo; said the guide.
&ldquo;I will dare to say that this boy lives a
merrier life, and wears more of that herb
called heart&#8217;s-ease in his bosom, than he
that is clad in silk and velvet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why should a man blush for his humble
origin? The Saviour&#8217;s mother was a poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
woman; and no head ever lay in a meaner
cradle than the manger where Mary laid
her first-born&mdash;the Son of the Most High
God. Why should any be ashamed of
honest poverty? Men of immortal names,
the apostles, were called from the lowest
ranks, and went forth to conquer and convert
the world without a penny in their
purse. Was not our Lord himself poor?
He earned His bread, and ate it, with the
sweat of His brow, while others lay luxuriously
on down; He had often no other
roof than the open sky, or warmer bed
than the dewy ground; and never had else
to entertain His guests than the coarsest
and most common fare&mdash;barley-loaves and
a few small fishes. Though rich in the
wealth of Godhead, with the resources of
heaven and of earth at His sovereign command,
poverty attended His steps like
His shadow, along the way from a humble
cradle to a bloody grave. He made Himself
poor that He might make us rich;
and it seemed meet that to poor rather
than to rich men God should reveal the
advent of Him who came to enrich the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
poor, whether kings or beggars, peers or
peasants. As if to censure the respect
paid to rank apart from merit, or to wealth
apart from worth, He who has no respect
for persons honoured in these shepherds
honest poverty and humble virtue. They
received ambassadors not accredited to
sovereigns; as cottages, not palaces, housed
Him whom the heavens have received, and
the heaven of heavens cannot contain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<h3>THEY WERE MEN ENGAGED IN COMMON
DUTIES.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>others cumbered with a load
of domestic cares, merchants
worried with business, statesmen
charged with their country&#8217;s
affairs, and thousands who have a
daily fight to keep the wolf from the
door, fancy that, if they enjoyed the leisure
some have, and could bestow more time
on divine things, they would be more religious
than they are, and, rising to higher,
calmer elevations of thought and temper,
would maintain a nearer communion with
God. It may reconcile such to their
duties to observe how the men were
employed on whom God bestowed this
unexpected and exalted honour. They
were engaged in the ordinary business of
their earthly calling; of a hard and humble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
one. Types of Him to whose care His
people owe their safety amid the temptations,
and their support amid the trials of
life, these shepherds were watching their
flocks; peering through the gloom of
night; listening for the stealthy step of
the robber; ready, starting to their feet,
to beat off the sneaking wolf, or bravely
battle with the roaring lion.</p>

<p>He whose sun shines as brightly on the
lowliest as on the stateliest flower, regards
with complacency the humblest man who
wins his daily bread, and discharges the
duties of his station, whatever they be, in
such a way as to glorify God and be of
advantage to his fellow-creatures. Heaven,
as this case brilliantly illustrates, is never
nearer men, nor are they ever nearer it,
than in those fields or workshops, where,
with honest purpose and a good conscience,
they are diligently pursuing their
ordinary avocations. No doubt&mdash;for God
does not cast His pearls before swine&mdash;these
shepherds were pious men. One
passing a night in their humble dwellings
would have seen the father with reverent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
mien gather his household to prayer; and
one passing these uplands, where they
held their watch, might have heard their
voices swaying on the midnight air, as
they sang together the psalms of David
amid the very scenes where he tuned his
harp and fed his father&#8217;s flocks. But
people are too apt to suppose that religion
lies mainly, if not exclusively, in prayers,
reading the Bible, listening to sermons,
and attending on sacraments; in time
spent, or work done, or offerings made,
or sacrifices endured, for what are called,
in common language, religious objects.
These are the means, not the end. He
who rises from his knees to his daily task,
and, with an eye not so much to please
men as God, does it well, carries divine
worship to the workshop, and throws a
sacred halo around the ordinary secularities
of life. That, indeed, may be the highest
expression of religion; just as it is the
highest expression of devoted loyalty to
leave the precincts of the court and the
presence of the sovereign, to endure the
hardships of a campaign, and stand in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
soiled and tattered regimentals by the
king&#8217;s colours amid the deadly hail of
battle. He who goes to common duties
in a devout and Christian spirit proves his
loyalty to God; and, as this case proves,
is of all men the most likely to be favoured
with tokens of the Divine presence&mdash;communications
of grace which will sustain
his patience under a life of toil, and fit
him for the rest that remaineth for the
people of God.</p>

<h2><i>PART IV.</i></h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>ingled with its rattling shingle,
the sea-beach bears hazel-nuts
and fir-tops&mdash;things which once
belonged to the blue hills that
rise far inland on the horizon. Dropped
into the brooks of bosky glens, they have
been swept into the river, to arrive, after
many windings and long wanderings, at
the ocean; to be afterwards washed ashore
with shells and wreck and sea-weed. The
Gulf Stream, whose waters by a beautiful
arrangement of Providence bring the heat
of southern latitudes to temper the wintry
rigour of the north, throws objects on the
western coasts of Europe which have performed
longer voyages&mdash;fruits and forest-trees
that have travelled the breadth of
the Atlantic, casting the productions of the
New World on the shores of the Old.</p>

<p>Like these, the record of events which
happened in the earliest ages of the world
has been carried along the course of time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and spread by the diverging streams of
population over the whole surface of the
globe. The facts are, as was to be expected,
always more or less changed, and
often, indeed, fragmentary. Still, like old
coins, which retain traces of their original
effigies and inscriptions, these traditions
possess a high historic value. Their remarkable
correspondence with the statements
of the Bible confirms our faith in
its divinity; and their being common to
nations of habits the most diverse, and of
habitations separated from each other by
the whole breadth of the earth, proves the
unity of our race. If they cannot be regarded
as pillars, they are buttresses of
the truth; being inexplicable on any
theory but that which infidelity has so
often, but always vainly, assailed, namely,
that all Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and that He has made of one
blood all the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>To take some examples. Look, for instance,
at a custom common among the
Red Indians, ages before white men had
crossed the sea and carried the Bible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
their shores! At the birth of a child, as
Humboldt relates, a fire was kindled on
the floor of the hut, and a vessel of water
placed beside it; but not with the murderous
intent of those savage tribes who
practise infanticide, and, pressed by hunger,
destroy their children to save their food.
The infant here was first plunged into the
water&mdash;buried, as we should say, in baptism;
and afterwards swept rapidly and
unharmed through the flaming fire. A
very remarkable rite; and one that, as
we read the story, recalled to mind this
double baptism, &ldquo;He shall baptize you,&rdquo;
said Jesus, &ldquo;with the Holy Ghost and
with fire;&rdquo; &ldquo;Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot see the
kingdom of God.&rdquo; Its administration to
infants, to such as had committed no sin,
nor knew, indeed, their right hand from
their left, implied a belief in the presence,
not of acquired, but of original impurity.
It is based on that; and without it this
rite is not only mysterious, but meaningless.
Blind is the eye which does not see
in this old pagan ceremony a tradition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the primeval Fall, and dull the ear which
does not hear in its voice no faint echo of
these words, &ldquo;I was shapen in iniquity,
and in sin did my mother conceive me.... Create
in me a clean heart, O God;
and renew a right spirit within me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like the Fall, the Flood also was an
event which, though it may have worn no
channel in the rocks, has left indelible
traces of its presence on the memory of
mankind. The Greeks had strange traditions
of this awful judgment; so had the
Romans; and so had almost all the
heathen nations of antiquity&mdash;strange
legends, to which the Bible supplies the
only key. Its account of the Deluge
explains the traditions, and the traditions
corroborate it; and by their general
mutual correspondence we are confirmed
in our belief that its authors were holy
men of old, who spoke as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost. To evade
this argument, infidels may trace these
legends to Jews, who, led captive of the
heathen, related to them the Mosaic story,
and took advantage of man&#8217;s love of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
marvellous to practise on his credulity.
The attempt is vain; since, on turning
from the Old World to the New, we find
the very same traditions there; and there,
long ages before Jew or Christian knew of
its existence, or had landed on its shores.
Those paintings which were to Mexicans
and Peruvians substitutes for history, for
a written or printed language, embody
the story of the Flood. One of these
pictures, for example, shows us a man
afloat with his family in a rude boat on a
shoreless sea; in another, the raven of
Bible story is cleaving on black wing the
murky sky; in a third, the heads of the
hills appear in the background like islands
emerging from the waste of waters, while,
with such confusion as is inseparable from
traditionary lore, the raven is substituted
for the dove, and appears making its way
to the lone tenants of the boat with evidence
of the subsidence of the waters&mdash;a
fir-cone in its bloody beak. Rolled
down the long stream of ages, the true
history is more or less changed, and even
fragmentary, like a water-worn stone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Still, between these traditionary records
and Bible story there is a remarkable
agreement. They sound like its echo.
In them pagan voices proclaim the holiness
of God. Lest we also should perish
with those who, looking on the placid sea
and starry sky of the Old World&#8217;s last
night, asked, &ldquo;Where is the promise of
His coming?&rdquo; they warn us to flee from
wrath to come.</p>

<p>Of all these venerable legends painted
in colours or embalmed in verse, written
in story or sculptured on stone, none are
more remarkable than those where the
serpent appears. Old divines imagined
that the creature whose shape Satan borrowed
for the temptation had originally no
malignant aspect; neither the poisoned
fangs, nor eyes of fire, nor cold, scaly,
wriggling form which man and beast recoil
from with instinctive horror. They fancied
that the curse, &ldquo;Upon thy belly shalt thou
go, and dust shalt thou eat,&rdquo; was followed
by a sudden metamorphosis, and that till
then the appearance of the serpent was as
lovely as it is now loathsome. They gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the words of the curse a literal interpretation.
They bear a deeper meaning, no
doubt; yet the fancy of these old divines
may have approached nearer to fact than
many perhaps suppose. Science reads the
history of remote ages as she finds it inscribed
on the rocks; and, on turning over
these stony leaves, we find that the earliest
form of the serpent was different from that
which, as it crawls and wriggles along the
ground, so forcibly recalls the very words
of the curse. Though they have now only
such powers of motion as belong to the
meanest worm, those skeletons which the
rocks entomb show that the serpent tribe
had once feet to walk with, and even wings
to spurn the ground and cleave the air.
Such is the testimony of the rocks! And,
taking the words of Scripture in their
literal sense, there is, to say the least of
it, a very curious coincidence between the
voices of the rocks and the voice of
revelation. But, be that as it may, what
else but fragmentary traditions of Eden
and the Fall are the forms of serpent
worship among the heathen, who acted, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
they still often act, on the principle of
propitiating the powers of evil, the many
old monuments on which its figure is sculptured,
and the many old legends in which
it plays a conspicuous part? What else
was the belief of our pagan fathers, that
within a dark cave in the bowels of the
earth there sat a great scaly dragon, brooding
on gold? What else was the fabled
garden of the Hesperides, where the trees,
guarded by a fierce and formidable serpent,
bore apples of gold? What else was
the tragic story of a father and his sons
dying by the bites and crushed within the
scaly folds of a coil of serpents; and on
which, as touchingly represented in the
sculptured marble, we have never looked
without recalling the fate of Adam and his
unhappy offspring? And what else is the
old legend of him who with rash hand
sowed serpent&#8217;s teeth, and saw spring from
the soil, not clustering vines, or feathery
palms, or stalks of waving corn, but a crop
of swords, and spears, and armed men?
Read that fable by the light of the Bible,
and the wild legend stands out the record of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
an awful fact. To the serpent the world
owes it wars, and discords, and the sin
which is their source. Disguised in its
form, Satan brought in sin; and when sin
entered on the scene, peace departed&mdash;peace
between God and man, peace between
man and man, peace between man
and himself&mdash;the peace which, with all its
blessings, He descended from heaven to
restore who is our Peace, and whom
angels ushered on the scene of His toils
and triumphs, of His atoning death and
glorious victory, with songs of &ldquo;Glory to
God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good-will toward men.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>VIII.</h2>

<h3>JESUS RESTORES PEACE BETWEEN GOD
AND MAN.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>here are things which God cannot
do&mdash;which it were not to honour
but dishonour Him to believe
He could. He can neither
tempt, nor be tempted, to sin. The sinner
He may love, but not his sin; that is
impossible; as the prophet expresses it,
&ldquo;Thou art of purer eyes than to behold
evil, and canst not look on iniquity.&rdquo;
Indeed, I would as soon believe that God
could condemn a holy spirit to the pains
of hell, as admit a guilty one, unjustified
and unsanctified, to the joys of heaven.
In that terrible indictment which God
thunders out against Israel by the mouth
of Ezekiel, He says, &ldquo;Thou art the land
which is not cleansed. Her princes in the
midst thereof are like wolves ravening the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls,
to get dishonest gain. Her prophets have
daubed them with untempered mortar,
saying, Thus saith the Lord God, when
the Lord hath not spoken. The people
of the land have used oppression, and
exercised robbery, and have vexed the
poor and needy; therefore have I poured
out mine indignation upon them; I have
consumed them with the fire of my wrath:
their own way have I recompensed upon
their heads, saith the Lord.&rdquo; So he arraigns
this and the other class. And how
of the priests? &ldquo;Her priests have violated
my law, and have profaned mine
holy things: they have put no difference
between the holy and profane, neither
have they showed difference between the
unclean and the clean.&rdquo; He censures
His servants for not separating between
the clean and unclean; and it insults Him
to suppose that He could do in His own
practice what He condemns in theirs.
Events, such as old murders brought to
light, ever and anon occur to show that
God&#8217;s mill, as runs the proverb, though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
grinds slow, grinds sure; yet because He
does not execute judgment speedily on
workers of iniquity&mdash;giving them space to
repent; because He often seems, like one
far remote from earth, to treat its crimes
and virtues with equal indifference, men
have not believed these solemn words,
&ldquo;There is no peace, saith my God, to the
wicked.&rdquo; But let the wicked hear His
words, and take the warning, &ldquo;Thou hatest
instruction; thou castest My words behind
thee. When thou sawest a thief, then thou
consentedst with him. Thou hast been partaker
with adulterers. Thou givest thy
mouth to evil, and thy tongue practiseth
deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against
thy brother; thou slanderest thine own
mother&#8217;s son. These things hast thou
done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
that I was altogether such an one as thyself:
but I will reprove thee, and set
them in order before thine eyes. Consider
this, ye that forget God, lest I tear
you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The universal conscience of mankind is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
stricken with a sense of guilt. Alarmed
by an instinctive sense of danger, men
have felt the need of reconciliation; and,
under a sense of His displeasure, have
everywhere, and in all ages, sought to
make their peace with God. For this end
altars were raised and temples built; sacrifices
offered, and penances endured. If
the colossal structures of Egypt, and the
lovely temples of Greece and Rome, were
erected, as well to adorn the state as to
please the gods, it was less to please approving,
than to appease angry divinities,
that their courts resounded with the cries
of victims, and smoking altars ran red with
blood. So much did the heathen feel
their need of peace, such store did they
set by it, that many of them sought it at
any price. They would buy peace at any
cost; nor did they shrink from giving
all their fortune, even the fruit of their
body, for the sin of their souls. For peace
with God the Hindoo walked to his distant
temples in sandals that, set with
spikes, pierced his flesh at every step, and
marked all the long, slow, painful journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
with a track of blood; for peace with
God the Syrian led his sweet boy up to
the fires of Moloch, and, unmoved in purpose
by cries, or curses, or passionate entreaties,
cast him shrieking on the burning
pile; for peace with God the Indian mother
approached the river&#8217;s brink with
streaming tears and trembling steps, and,
tearing the suckling from her bursting
heart, kissed it, to turn away her eyes, and
fling it into the flood. We pity their ignorance.
But how do they rebuke the indifference
of many; their unwillingness to
submit to any sacrifice whatever for the
honour of Jesus and the interests of their
souls? These heathens may pity thousands
whom they shall rise up in judgment
to condemn. Neglecting the great
salvation, preferring the pleasures of sin,
what a contrast do these offer to a poor
Hindoo, who, hearing a missionary tell of
the blood of Christ, sprang from the
ground, and, loosing his bloody sandals,
flung them away to exclaim, &ldquo;Now, now
I have found what I want!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peace which he found all men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
want, and shall find in Jesus, if they seek
it honestly, earnestly. God has no pleasure
in the death of the wicked. He never had.
We pronounce him an unnatural father,
who, on a breach occurring between him
and his child, though he is the injured and
not the injurer, does not long to be reconciled&mdash;is
not the first to make advances
and overtures of peace. In this feature of
the parental character God has stamped
upon our hearts the beautiful image of His
own. Yearning over them as the kind old
man over his wayward prodigal, his exiled
child, God was willing to receive back
sinners to His arms; to reinstate them in
His family, and restore them to His favour.
But how was this to be done?&mdash;done without
dishonour to His holy law, and with
due regard to His character as a God of
truth. He had said, &ldquo;The soul that sinneth
shall die;&rdquo; nor could peace be restored
between Him and man but on such
terms as maintained His truth. A father
or mother punishes one child, and allows
another, guilty of the same offence, to go
free. But had God cast fallen angels into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
hell, and, without any regard to His word,
admitted fallen men to heaven, what had
angels, what had devils, what had men
themselves thought of a God who conducted
his government with such caprice&mdash;playing
fast and loose with His most solemn
words? &ldquo;The way of the Lord,&rdquo; said
ancient Israel, &ldquo;is not equal;&rdquo; and in
such a case there had been ground for the
charge, and none for the indignation with
which He repels it, saying, &ldquo;Hear now,
O Israel, is not my way equal? are not
yours unequal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was only one way of restoring
peace; but it involved a sacrifice on God&#8217;s
part which the most sanguine had never
dared to hope for. If the Lord of heaven
and earth, veiling His glory, would assume
our nature, would take the form of a servant,
would stoop to the work of a subject,
would die the death of a sinner, we might
be saved&mdash;not otherwise; if He would
leave heaven, we might enter it&mdash;not otherwise;
if He would die, we might live&mdash;not
otherwise; if He would enter the grave its
captor, we might leave it its conquerors&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
otherwise; if He, as our substitute,
would fulfil the requirements of the law,
both in doing our work and discharging our
debt, both obeying and suffering in our
stead, peace could be restored&mdash;not otherwise.
For these ends God did not spare
His Son, but gave Him up to death, &ldquo;that
whosoever believeth in him might not perish,
but have everlasting life;&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;set time&rdquo; having come at length, Jesus
descended on our world, to make peace
through the blood of His cross&mdash;His angel-train,
ere they returned to heaven, holding
a concert in the skies.</p>

<p>Dying, the just for the unjust, He has
made peace; and these are the easy terms,
&ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saved.&rdquo; How gladly should
we accept them? If men reject peace,
what chance for them in war? &ldquo;Hast thou
an arm like God? Canst thou thunder
with a voice like him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let the potsherds
strive with the potsherds of the
earth; but woe to the man who striveth
with his Maker!&rdquo; He has proclaimed a
truce&mdash;granting a suspension of arms, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
offering most generous proposals of peace.
How should men improve the pause, and
accept the overtures!&mdash;as eagerly seizing
salvation through the cross of Christ as a
drowning man life through the rope some
kind hand flings within his reach. In
warfare patriots have stood up gallantly
against overwhelming odds, and, closing
their broken ranks, have said, &ldquo;Better fall
on the field, better lose life than honour;&rdquo;
but when sinners, dropping the weapons
of rebellion, yield themselves up to God,
honour is not lost, but won, in a crown
that fadeth not away. Brave men have
said, &ldquo;Better fight to the last, die with our
swords in our hands, than become captives
to pine away a weary, ignoble life within
the walls of a prison;&rdquo; but when the sinner
gives himself up to God, he goes not to
exile but home; not to chains and a dungeon,
but to glorious freedom, a palace,
and a throne. God asks you to give up
your sins that they, not you, may be slain.
It is of them, not of you, He says, &ldquo;But
those mine enemies which would not that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
I should reign over them, bring hither,
and slay them before me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these circumstances, oh for the wisdom
of her who showed herself on the city
walls in the thick of the assault, crying to
Joab, &ldquo;Hear, hear, come near hither, I
pray you, that I may speak with thee!&rdquo;
A woman&#8217;s figure there, her voice sounding
above the thunder of the captains and the
shouting, suspends the attack. Assailants
and assailed alike rest on their arms; and
as one marked as a leader by his plume
and bearing, covered with the dust and
blood of battle, steps forward, she bends
over the battlements to ask, &ldquo;Art thou
Joab?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; is the reply. &ldquo;Then
hear the words of thy handmaid,&rdquo; she cries;
&ldquo;I am one of them that are peaceable and
faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy
a city and a mother in Israel!&rdquo; He solemnly
repudiates the charge. &ldquo;Far be it
from me,&rdquo; he answers, &ldquo;that I should
swallow up and destroy. The matter is not
so: but a man of Mount Ephraim, Sheba,
the son of Bichri, hath lifted up his hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
against the king, against David: deliver
him only, and I will depart from the city.&rdquo;
She accepts the terms; and saying &ldquo;Behold,
his head shall be thrown to thee
over the wall&rdquo;&mdash;vanishes. Prompt in
action as wise in counsel, she goes to the
people, deals with them, sways the multitude
to her will; and ere the last hour of
the brief truce has closed, a bloody head
goes bounding over the wall. It rolls like
a ball to the feet of Joab; and in its grim
and ghastly features they recognise the
face of the son of Bichri. So Joab blows
the trumpet, and the host retires from the
walls, every man to his own tent. So let
men deal with their sins. Let them die
with the son of Bichri: they have &ldquo;lifted up
their hand against the King.&rdquo; Why should
we spare them, and lose our souls? By
His precious blood Jesus has opened up
a way to peace. He has come, but not
&ldquo;to swallow up and destroy.&rdquo; Blessed
Lord, He came to save, not to destroy.
&ldquo;O earth, earth, earth,&rdquo; cried the prophet,
&ldquo;hear the word of the Lord;&rdquo; and be it
known to the world&#8217;s utmost bounds that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
God willeth not the death of the sinner,
but rather that he would turn to Him and
live. With her flaming sword, red with
the blood of men and angels, Justice holds
to us no other language but that of Joab,
&ldquo;Deliver up your sins only, and I will
depart!&rdquo; and, inspired of God with the
wisdom that chooseth the better part, and
maketh wise unto salvation, let us say,
&ldquo;Better my sins die than I; better Satan
be cast, than Jesus be kept out of it;
better strike off the heads of a thousand
sins that have lifted up their hands against
the King, than that I should fall&mdash;sparing
my sins to lose my soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>hab and Jezebel, two of the
worst characters in sacred story,
had a son; and with such blood
as theirs in his veins, no wonder
that Joram, on succeeding to the
throne of one parent, exhibited the vices
of both. His mother does not seem to
have had a drop of human-kindness in
her breast. Yet he was not altogether
dead to humanity, as appears by an incident
which occurred during the siege that
reduced his capital to the direst extremities.
The ghastly aspect of a famished
woman who throws herself in his way with
a wild, impassioned, wailing cry of &ldquo;Help,
my lord, O king!&rdquo; touches him; and he
asks, &ldquo;What aileth thee?&rdquo; Stretching out a
skinny arm to one pale and haggard as
herself, she replies, with hollow voice,
&ldquo;This woman said unto me, Give thy
son, that we may eat him to-day, and we
will eat my son to-morrow. So we boiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
my son, and did eat him: and I said unto
her on the next day, Give thy son, that
we may eat him; and she hath hid her
son.&rdquo; Struck with horror at the story,
Joram rent his clothes. He had pity, but
no piety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should ye be stricken any more?
ye will but revolt more and more.&rdquo; Never
were these words, never was the fact that
unsanctified afflictions have the same hardening
effect on men which fire, that
melts gold, has on clay, more strikingly
illustrated than on this occasion. So far
from rending his heart with his garment,
and humbling himself before the Lord,
Joram flares up into fiercer rebellion; and
turning from these victims of the famine
to his courtiers, he grinds his teeth to
profane God&#8217;s name and vow vengeance
on his prophet, saying, &ldquo;God do so and
more also to me, if the head of Elisha the
son of Shaphat shall stand on him this
day.&rdquo; Impotent rage against the only man
who could have weathered the storm, and
saved the state! The prophet&#8217;s head
stood on his shoulders when that of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
son of a murderer&mdash;as Elisha called him&mdash;lay
low in death in the dust of Naboth&#8217;s
vineyard. The day arrives which sees the
cup of Joram&#8217;s iniquity full, and that of
God&#8217;s patience empty&mdash;drained to the last
drop. The chief officers of the army are
sitting outside their barrack, when one
wearing a prophet&#8217;s livery approaches them.
Singling out Jehu from the group, he says,
I have an errand to thee, O captain!
The captain rises; they pass in alone;
the door is shut; and now this strange,
unknown man, drawing a horn of oil from
his shaggy cloak, pours it on Jehu&#8217;s head.
As if it had fallen on fire, it kindled up
his smouldering ambition&mdash;so soon at
least as this speech interpreted the act,
&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I
have anointed thee king over the people
of this land. Thou shall smite the house
of Ahab thy master; dogs shall eat Jezebel
in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall
be none to bury her.&rdquo; Having spoken so,
the stranger opens the door, and flies.
But faster flies God&#8217;s vengeance. Ere his
feet have borne the servant to Elisha&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
door, the banner of revolt is up, unfurled;
troops are gathering to the sound of
trumpets; and soldiers, eager for change
and plunder, are making the air ring to
the cry, Jehu is king!</p>

<p>Launched like a thunderbolt at the
house of Ahab, Jehu makes right for
Jezreel with impetuous, impatient speed.
A watchman on the palace tower catches
afar the dust of the advancing cavalcade,
and cries, I see a company! Guilt, which
sleeps uneasy even on downy pillows,
awakens, on the circumstance being reported
to him, the monarch&#8217;s fears. A
horseman is quickly despatched with the
question, Is it peace? Thus, pulling up
his steed, he accosts the leader of the
company, who, drawing no rein, replies,
in a tone neither to be challenged nor
disobeyed, What hast thou to do with
peace? Get thee behind me! Failing
the first&#8217;s return, a second horseman gallops
forth to carry the same question and
meet the same reception. Sweeping on
like a hurricane, the band is now near
enough for the watchman to tell, &ldquo;He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
came near unto them, and cometh not
again;&rdquo; and also to add, as he marks how
their leader is shaking the reins and lashing
the steeds of his bounding chariot,
&ldquo;The driving is like the driving of Jehu,
the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.&rdquo;
Displaying a courage that seemed
his only redeeming quality, or bereaved of
sense, according to the saying, Whom God
intends to destroy He first makes mad,
Joram instantly throws himself into his
chariot, advances to meet the band, and
demands of its leader, Is it peace, Jehu?
What peace, is the other&#8217;s answer, so long
as the whoredoms of thy mother and her
witchcrafts are so many? With the words
that leave his lips an arrow leaves his
bow to transfix the flying king&mdash;entering
in at his back and passing out at his
breast; and when he is cast, a bloody
corpse, into Naboth&#8217;s vineyard, and dogs
are crunching his mother&#8217;s bones, and
Jehu has climbed the throne, and Elisha
walks abroad with his head safe on his
shoulders, and the curtain falls on the
stage of these tragic and righteous scenes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
it was a time for the few pious men of that
guilty land to sing, &ldquo;Lo thine enemies, O
Lord, lo thine enemies shall perish; but
the righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree:
they shall grow like a cedar of
Lebanon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the mission of Jehu, the son
of Nimshi. How different that of Jesus,
the Son of God! They might have been
identical; presented at least grounds of
comparison rather than grounds of striking
contrast. Yet so remarkable is the contrast
that Jehu&#8217;s mission&mdash;and therefore
have we related the story&mdash;forms as effective
a background to Christ&#8217;s, as the black
rain-cloud to the bright bow which spans
it. The cause of the difference lies in
God&#8217;s free, gracious, sovereign mercy&mdash;in
nothing else; for had mankind, at the
tidings that the Son of God, attended by
a train of holy angels, was approaching,
met Him on the confines of our world
with Joram&#8217;s question, &ldquo;Is it peace?&rdquo; that
question might justly have met with Jehu&#8217;s
answer, &ldquo;What hast thou to do with
peace?&rdquo;&mdash;what have you done to obtain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
it, or to deserve it? Yet, glory be to God
in the highest, it is peace&mdash;peace more
plainly and fully announced in these most
gracious words, &ldquo;It pleased the Father
that in him should all fulness dwell; and,
having made peace through the blood of
his cross, by him to reconcile all things to
himself, whether they be things on earth,
or things in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>IX.</h2>

<h3>JESUS BRINGS PEACE TO THE SOUL.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>aving reconciled us to God by
the blood of His cross, Christ
is &ldquo;our Peace,&rdquo; as the apostle
says. He is called so, first, because
He restores us to a state of friendship
with God; and, secondly, because a
sense of that fills the whole soul with a
peace which passeth understanding. So,
speaking of the righteousness which Christ
wrought out for us, the prophet says,
&ldquo;The work of righteousness is peace&rdquo;&mdash;His
righteousness being the root, and our
peace the fruit&mdash;that the spring, and this
the stream. To describe for the comfort
of the Church the constancy of the last
and the fulness of the first, another prophet
borrows two of nature&#8217;s grandest
images, &ldquo;Thy peace shall be like a river,
and thy righteousness like the waves of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the sea&rdquo;&mdash;the believer&#8217;s peace flowing
like a broad, deep stream, with life in its
waters and smiling verdure on its banks;
and a Saviour&#8217;s righteousness covering all
his sins, as the waves do the countless
sands of their shore, when, burying them
out of sight, the tide converts the whole
reach of dull, dreary sand into a broad
liquid mirror, to reflect the light of the
sky and the beams of the sun.</p>

<p>Christ&#8217;s imputed righteousness is bestowed
equally on all believers&mdash;none,
the least any more than the greatest
sinner, being more justified than another.
Feeling assured or not of their salvation,
all His are equally safe&mdash;&ldquo;those whom
Thou hast given me I have kept, and
none of them are lost.&rdquo; There is no
such equal enjoyment among believers of
peace in believing; some walking all
their days under a cloud, and some who
walk in darkness and have no light, only
reaching heaven, like a blind man guided
homewards by the hand of his child, by
their hold of the promise, Who is he that
feareth the Lord and obeyeth the voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of His servant, that walketh in darkness
and hath no light; let him trust in the
name of the Lord, and stay himself in his
God. But where there is peace springing
from a sense of forgiveness, of all the
fruits of the Spirit that grow in Christ&#8217;s
fair garden, this is sweetest. Among the
blessings enjoyed on earth, it has no
superior, or rival even. It passeth understanding,
says an apostle. Nor did David
regard any as happy but those who enjoyed
it&mdash;pronouncing &ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; not the
great, or rich, or noble, or famous, but
&ldquo;the man,&rdquo; whatever his condition, &ldquo;whose
transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
covered.&rdquo; And so he might. With this
peace the believer regards death as the
gate of life: enters the grave as a quiet
anchorage from seas and storms; and
looks forward to the scene of final judgment
as a prince to his coronation, or a
happy bride to her marriage day. A sense
of forgiveness lays the sick head on a
pillow softer than downs; lightens sorrow&#8217;s
heaviest burdens; makes poverty rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
beyond the wealth of banks; spoils death
of his sting; arms the child of God against
the ills of life; and, lifting him up above
its trials, makes him like some lofty mountain,
at whose feet the lake may be lashed
into foaming billows, and adown whose
seamed and rugged sides clouds may fall
in gloomy folds, but whose head, shooting
up into the calm blue heavens, reposes
in unbroken peace, rejoices in perpetual
sunshine.</p>

<p>Happy such as obtain a firm hold of
Christ, and, having made their calling and
election sure, enjoy unclouded peace!
Feeling that there is now no more condemnation
for them, because they believe
in Jesus, and walk not after the flesh but
after the spirit, they see a change come on
objects such as imparts pleasure and surprise
in what are called dissolving views.
Where death, with grim and grisly aspect,
stood by the mouth of an open grave,
shaking his fatal dart, we see an angel
form opening with one hand the gate of
heaven, and holding in the other a shining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
crown&mdash;from the face of God we see the
features of an angry, stern, inexorable
judge melt all away, and in room of an
object of terror we behold the face and
form of a kind, loving, forgiving Father,
with open arms hastening to embrace us.
The God of hope give you joy and peace
in believing, is the prayer of the apostle&mdash;a
prayer in many cases so fully answered
that the dying saint has been borne away
from all his earthly moorings; and, ready
to part from wife and children, has exclaimed
with Simeon when he held the
infant Saviour in his joyful arms, &ldquo;Now,
Lord, lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be at peace among yourselves,&rdquo; is a
blessed injunction which an apostle lays
on families, on friends, and on churches.
In happy contrast to the storm which,
hurtling through the troubled air, and
shaking doors and windows, goes raving
round every corner of the house, let peace
reign on the domestic hearth, and also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
within the church, when, like the ark of
old, she drifts on the billows of a shoreless
sea&mdash;God only at the helm.</p>

<p>It is good to be at peace with our brethren,
but to be at peace with one&#8217;s-self is
better. At peace with conscience, one
can afford, if God will have it so, to be at
war with all men. It is painful, when we
cannot be at peace with all men&mdash;to have
enemies without; but his case is infinitely
worse who lodges an enemy in his own
breast&mdash;in a guilty, uneasy conscience, in
self-reproaches, in terror of death, in the
knowledge that God and he are not
friends, nor can be so, so long as he
cherishes his sins. There is no peace,
saith my God, to the wicked. There
cannot be. Drugged with narcotics, you
may sleep as quietly on a bed of thorns
as of roses. Drugged with narcotics, you
may lie down on the cold pavement, and
fancy as you throw your arms around the
curbstone that it is the wife of your bosom.
Drugged with narcotics, you may go to
sleep in a cell with visions of home playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
round the head that shall be capped
for hanging to-morrow. But no more
than I call these peaceful sights, can I
apply the name of peace to the insensibility
of a conscience seared by sin; to the
calmness, or rather callousness of one who
has allowed the devil to persuade him that
God is too merciful to reckon with us for
our transgressions. The peace we are to
seek, and, seeking to pursue, is not that
of death, but life,&mdash;not that the lake presents
in winter, when no life appears on
its shores, nor sound breaks the silence of
its frozen waters; but that of a lake
which, protected from tempests by lofty
mountains, carries life in its waters, beauty
on its banks, and heaven mirrored in its
unruffled bosom. Being justified by faith
we have peace with God through our Lord
Jesus Christ. Such is the peace which
we are to seek&mdash;a peace which, springing
from a sense of reconciliation through the
blood of the Lamb and wrought within
the soul by the in-dwelling of the Holy
Spirit, has so raised the saint above all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fears of death, and shed such a flood of
glory around his dying head, that wicked
men have turned from the scene to exclaim,
May I die the death of the righteous,
and may my last end be like his!</p>

<h3>JESUS SHALL BRING PEACE TO THE WORLD.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>ow many pages of history are
written with the point of the
sword&mdash;not with ink, but tears
and blood? It is chiefly taken
up with the recital of wars. What
age has not been the era, what country
the scene of bloody strifes? What soil
does not hold the dust of thousands that
have fallen by brothers&#8217; hands? Our
glebes have been fattened with the bodies
of the slain? On those fields where, with
the lark carolling overhead, the peasant
drives his ploughshare, other steel than the
sickle has glanced, and other shouts have
risen than those of happy reapers bearing
some blushing, sun-browned maid on their
broad shoulders at the Harvest Home.
The tall gray stones, the hoary cairns, tell
how on other days these quiet scenes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
were disturbed by the roar of battle, and
lay red with another dye than that of
heath or purple wild flowers. Go wherever
our foot may wander, we find tokens
of war; and select what age soever we
may, since Abel fell beneath a brother&#8217;s
hand, we find in man&#8217;s first death, and the
earth&#8217;s first lone grave, a bloody omen of
future and frequent crimes. What a commentary
is human history on these words
of Holy Scripture, &ldquo;The whole creation
groaneth, and travaileth in pain till now!&mdash;nor
shall it cease to groan, or hail the day
of its redemption, till the Prince of Peace
is enthroned in the heart of all nations,
and the labours of missionaries have extended
that kingdom to the ends of the
earth, whose triumphs are bloodless&mdash;whose
walls are Salvation and her gates
Praise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without disparagement to the happy
influence of education, the extension of
commerce, and the efforts of benevolent
men, the real Peace Society is the Church
of God; the olive branch which the Spirit,
dove-like, is bearing on blessed wing to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
troubled world, is the Word of God; and
the gospel&#8217;s is the voice which, like Christ&#8217;s
on Galilee&#8217;s waves, shall speak peace to a
distracted earth, and change its wildest
passions into a holy calm. Till all nations
receive the Bible in its integrity and
own it as their only rule of policy, till
kings reign for Christ and lay their crowns
at His feet, a lasting peace is an idle
dream. Treaties will no more bind nations
that lie under the influence of unsanctified
passions, that chains him who
dwelt among the tombs, and within whom
dwelt a legion of devils. Till other and
better days come, the best cemented peace
is only a pause&mdash;a truce&mdash;an armistice;
the breathing-time of exhausted combatants.
Alas, that it should be so: yet true
it is, that that nation dooms itself to disaster,
if not destruction, which, pursuing
only the arts of peace, leaves its swords to
rust, and its navies to rot, and forts with
empty embrasures to moulder into ruins.
The trumpet of the world&#8217;s Jubilee has
not yet sounded, nor have all the vials of
the Apocalypse been emptied of the wrath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of God. And so, till the nations have
emerged from spiritual darkness; till
God&#8217;s Word is an open book, and duly
honoured in all lands; till immorality
has ceased to weaken the bonds of social
happiness, discontent to rankle in the
bosom of the people, and ambition to fire
the breasts of kings, the world may expect
ever and anon to hear the voice of Joel
sounding out this trumpet call, &ldquo;Prepare
ye war; wake up the mighty men; let all
the men of war draw near&mdash;beat your
ploughshares into swords and your pruning-hooks
into spears&mdash;put ye in the
sickle, for the harvest is ripe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Better days are coming&mdash;some think
near at hand. Turning a seer&#8217;s eye on
futurity, Isaiah descried them in the far
distance&mdash;saw the reign of the Prince of
Peace&mdash;Jesus crowned King of kings and
Lord of lords&mdash;swords beaten into ploughshares
and spears into pruning-hooks&mdash;every
man, whether at hall or cottage
door, sitting under the shade of his vine
and fig-tree&mdash;the whole earth quiet, and
at rest. And glad is the Church, as,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
weary of strife and sin and sorrow, she
looks up into the darksome sky, and cries,
Watchman, what of the night? to get a
hopeful response,&mdash;to catch any sign, in
break, or blush, or gray gleam however
feeble, that seems to reply, The morning
cometh! Come blessed morn, come
Prince of Peace&mdash;come Lord Jesus&mdash;come
quickly! Let wars cease unto the
ends of the earth! Scatter Thou the
people that delight in war.</p>

<p>The vision tarries, but come it shall.
In answer to the cry of blood that rises
to heaven with a different voice from that
of Abel&#8217;s, peace shall reign and wars shall
cease. By the hands that men nailed to
a cross God will break the bow, the battle,
and the spear&mdash;burning the chariot in the
fire. And though any peace which our
age may enjoy should be only a breathing-time,
but a pause in the roar of the bloody
tempest, let us improve it to remedy all
wrongs at home; to educate our ignorant
and neglected masses; to eradicate the
vices that disgrace and degrade our nation;
to build up the Church wherever it lies in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
ruins; to extend not so much Britain&#8217;s
empire as Christ&#8217;s kingdom abroad, and
so hasten forward the happy time when
the Song of the Angels shall be echoed
from every land, and the voices of the
skies of Bethlehem shall be lost in the
grander, fuller, nobler chorus of all nations,
singing, Glory to God in the highest, peace
on earth, good will toward men!</p>

<span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>hough the last to be dropped
into its place, the keystone
is of all the stones of an arch
the first in importance; the
others span no flood, carry no weight, are
of no value, without it. It gives unity to
the separate parts, and locking all together,
makes them one. Of such consequence
to the other parts of the Angels&#8217; Song is
its last clause. It was not simply Glory
to God, nor peace on earth, but good
will toward men, which made the angels
messengers of mercy, and the news they
brought tidings of great joy. Glory to
God! Amid the rush of the waters that
drowned the world, and the roar of the
flames that laid Sodom in ashes, they sang
glory to God. God is glorious in acts of
judgment as well as in acts of mercy&mdash;&ldquo;the
God of Glory thundereth.&rdquo; So on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
shores strewn with the corpses of the dead,
beside a sea which opened its gates for
the escape of Israel and closed them on
Egypt, burying king and bannered host
beneath its whirling waves, Moses and
Miriam cried, Sing ye to the Lord, for He
hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and
his rider hath He cast into the sea!
Then the deep lifted up its voice, and all
the waves of the sea sang Glory to God!
as, bearing the dead in on their foaming
crests, they laid them at Moses&#8217; feet. And
when that judgment comes to which these
are but as the big drops that prepare us for
a burst of thunder and the rushing rain,
when the great white throne is set, and
the books are opened, and the Judge
rises in awful majesty to pronounce words
of doom, the voices of ten times ten
thousand saints shall add, Amen; and
in an outburst of praise that drowns
the wail of the lost, the whole host of
angels shall sing, Glory to God! With
such ascription of praise Christ&#8217;s heralds
would have announced His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
advent, had He come not to save, but to
destroy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory to God,&rdquo; the first clause of this
song, does not, therefore, necessarily involve
good will towards men; and no
more does the second, &ldquo;peace on earth.&rdquo;
Peace! Peace was in the valley where
the prophet stood with the grim wrecks of
war around him,&mdash;friend and foe sleeping
side by side, skeletons silently turning to
dust, and swords to rust. Peace is in the
battle-field when the last gun is fired, and,
the last of the dying having groaned out
his soul in a gush of blood, the heaving
mass is still. Peace was on the sea and
the storm suddenly became a calm, when
the waves leaping up against the flying
ship obtained their prey, and from the
deck where he stood summoned by the
voice, Arise, O thou that sleepest, and
call upon thy God, Jonah was flung into
the jaws of death. Peace was in that land
he had ravaged of whom men said, &ldquo;He
made a solitude, and called it peace,&rdquo;&mdash;all
its homesteads lay in ashes, and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
cities stood in silent ruins. Peace was in
Israel, when, provoked by their sins, God
cast His people out: swept them all into
captivity. The land had its Sabbaths
then. The Angels&#8217; Song might have announced
a similar, but greater, judgment&mdash;that,
as a landlord clears his estate of
turbulent, lawless, bankrupt tenants, God,
who had repented long ago that He had
made man, was at length coming to clear
the earth of his guilty presence, and make
room for better tenants; a purer, holier
race. It is the last clause of this hymn,
therefore, that gives it an aspect of mercy&mdash;the
revenue of glory which God was to
receive, and the peace which earth was to
enjoy, flowing from that fountain of redeeming
love which had its spring in God&#8217;s
good will. Of this Christ was the divine
expression, and angels were the happy
messengers.</p>

<p>Happy messengers indeed! No wonder
they hastened their flight to earth, and having
announced the good tidings, lingered
over the fields of Bethlehem, singing as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
they hovered on the wing. To announce
bad news is the unenviable office often
imposed on ministers of the gospel; and
recollecting with what slow, reluctant steps
my feet approached the house where I had
to break to a mother the tidings of the
wreck, and how her sailor boy with all
hands had perished; or, in the news of a
husband&#8217;s sudden death, I had to plant a
dagger in the heart of a young, bright,
happy wife. I never have read the story
of Absalom&#8217;s tragic end, without wondering
at the race between Ahimaaz and
Cushi who should first carry the tidings to
David. It had been easier, I think, to
look the foe in the face and hear the roar
of battle than see the old man&#8217;s grief, and
hear that heart-broken cry, &ldquo;O Absalom,
my son, my son Absalom, would God I
had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
my son!&rdquo; I can enter into the feelings
of the two Marys, when, to quote the
words of Holy Scripture, &ldquo;they departed
quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
great joy, and did run to bring the disciples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
word.&rdquo; I see them, as, regardless of appearances,
and saluting no one, they press
on, along the road, through the streets,
with panting breath and gleaming eye and
streaming hair and flying feet, striving who
shall be first to proclaim the resurrection,
and burst in on the disciples with the glad
tidings, crying, &ldquo;The Lord is risen!&rdquo;
Teaching the Churches how to strive, their
only rivalry who shall first carry the tidings
of salvation to heathen lands, I dare
to say those holy women never took such
bounding steps, nor sped on their way
with such haste before. And never, I
fancy, did angels leave the gates of heaven
so fast behind them, pass suns and stars
in downward flight on such rapid wing, as
when they hasted to earth with the tidings
of great joy. May we be as eager to accept
salvation as they were to announce
it! May the love of God find a responsive
echo within our bosoms! Would that our
wishes for His glory corresponded to His
for our good, and that His good will toward
us awoke a corresponding good will
toward Him&mdash;felt in hearts glowing with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
zeal for Christ&#8217;s cause, and expressed in
lives wholly consecrated to His service.</p>

<p>In studying this, we shall now consider
the persons to whom good will is expressed.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<h2>XI.</h2>

<h3>THE PERSONS TO WHOM GOOD WILL IS
EXPRESSED.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>t is expressed to men&mdash;to all
men; so that if we are finally
lost, the blame as well as the
bane is ours. God has no ill
will to us, or to any. He has no pleasure
in the death of the wicked; nor is He
willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to Him, and live. His good
will embraces the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I consider thy heavens, the
work of thy fingers, the moon and the
stars which thou hast ordained; what is
man, that thou art mindful of him? and
the Son of man, that thou visitest him?&rdquo;
So said the royal psalmist. And, in a
sense, time should only have deepened
the astonishment which this question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
expresses. For man&#8217;s ideas of the magnificence
of the heavens have grown with
the course of ages; and though the stars
in the transparent atmosphere of Palestine
shone with a brilliancy unknown to us,
our conceptions of the heavens are grander
and more true than David&#8217;s&mdash;thanks to
the discoveries of modern science. As
navigators, so soon as by help of the
mariner&#8217;s compass they could push their
bold prows into untravelled seas, were
ever adding new continents to the land
and new islands to the ocean, so, since
the invention of the telescope, science has
been discovering new stars in the heavens;
filling up their empty spaces with stellar
systems, and vastly enlarging the limits of
creation. And since every new orb has
added to the lustre of Jehovah&#8217;s glory,
another world to His kingdom, another
jewel to His crown, these discoveries, by
exalting God still higher, have added point
and power to the old question, &ldquo;What
is man, that thou art mindful of him?
and the Son of man, that thou visitest
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Yet, apart from man&#8217;s sinfulness, I cannot
feel that he is beneath the regards of
the Maker and Monarch of the starry
heavens. I can fancy that an earthly
sovereign who, dwelling apart from his
people, is jealous of their intrusion within
his palace gates, and sits enthroned amid
an exclusive though brilliant circle of proud
and powerful barons, may neither know
nor care about the fortunes of lowly cottagers;
but there could be no greater mistake
than out of such a man&#8217;s character
to weave our conceptions of God, or fancy
that because we are infinitely beneath His
rank, we are therefore beneath His notice.
A glance at the meanest of His creatures
refutes and rebukes the unworthy thought.
It needs no angels from heaven to inform
us that God cherishes good will to all the
creatures of His hand, nor deems the least
of them beneath His kind regards. Look
at bird, or butterfly, or beetle! Observe
the lavish beauty that adorns His creatures,
the bounty that supplies their wants, the
care taken of their lives, the happiness,
expressed in songs or merry gambols or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
mazy dances, which He has poured into
their hearts. The whole earth is full of
the glory of God&#8217;s infinite benignity and
good will. Insignificant as I&mdash;a speck on
earth, and earth itself but a speck in creation&mdash;seem
to myself when, standing below
the starry vault, I look up into the
heavens, yet, apart from the thought that
I am a sinner, I cannot say, What is man,
that thou art mindful of him? How can
I, when I see Him mindful of the brood
that sleep in their rocking nest, of the
moth that flits by my face on muffled
wing, of the fox that howls on the hill, of
the owl that hoots to the pale moon from
ivy tower or hollow tree? Are you not of
more value than many sparrows? said our
Lord. Fashioned originally after the
divine image, with a soul outweighing in
value the rude matter of a thousand
worlds, able to rise on the wings of
contemplation above the highest stars
and hold communion with God himself,
man, apart from his sinfulness, was every
way worthy of divine good will; that God
should be mindful of him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
But we are sinners&mdash;sinners by nature
as well as practice; polluted; unholy;
so unclean that our emblem is that hideous
form which, from the crown of the
head to the soles of the feet, is wounds
and bruises and putrifying sores; and the
news that God cherishes good will to such
guilty creatures may well evoke the old,
wondering cry, Hear, O heavens; be
astonished, O earth! On recalling the
happy days of early life, when, a child, he
lay in his father&#8217;s arms; a boy, he sat on
his knee; a youth, he walked by his side&mdash;the
tears that at parting streamed over
the old man&#8217;s cheeks&mdash;his kind counsels,
his tender warnings, his warm kisses, and
how he had stood and watched his departing
steps till the brow of a hill or a turn
of the road hid him from view, the poor
prodigal ventured to hope that his father
would not turn him from his door; for
the sake of the past and of his mother in
the grave, would grant him at least a
servant&#8217;s place. Weighed down by a sense
of guilt, his hopes rose to no higher flight&mdash;expected
nothing beyond a menial&#8217;s office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
To be received with open arms, to be welcomed
back again like some youth who
has gone abroad to win a fortune or be
crowned with laurels&mdash;that his should be
the fairest robe, the finest ring, the fatted
calf&mdash;that instead of stealing in under
the cloud of night to be concealed from
strangers&#8217; eyes, the old house on his return
should ring to the sound of music, and
floors should shake to the dancers&#8217; feet,
and the whole neighbourhood should be
called to rejoice with a father whose
shame and sorrow he had been, was a turn
of fortune he never dreamt of; never
dared to hope for. On the part of that
loving, forgiving father, what amazing good
will! But how much more amazing this
which God proclaimed by the lips of
angels, and proved by the death of His
beloved Son!</p>

<p>I have known fathers and mothers who
were sorely tried by wayward, wicked
children&mdash;I have seen their gray hairs go
down with sorrow to the grave. With
hearts bleeding under wounds from the
hands of one they loved, I have seen them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
welcome the grave; saying as they descended
into its quiet rest, &ldquo;the days of my
mourning are ended.&rdquo; It is a horrid crime
to wring tears from such eyes, to crush such
hearts: but was ever patient, hoping, loving
parent tried as we have tried our
Father in heaven? Not without reason
does He ask, &ldquo;If I be a father, where is
mine honour? if I be a master, where is
my fear?&rdquo; And who that thinks of his
sins, their guilt, their number, and, as
committed against infinite love and tender
mercy, their unspeakable atrocity, but
will acknowledge the truth of these words,
&ldquo;Because I am God, and not man, therefore
the children of men are not consumed&rdquo;&mdash;just
as it is because the ship
rides by a cable, and not a cobweb, that,
when sails are rent, and yards are gone,
and breakers are foaming on the reef, she
mounts the billows and survives the storm.
That we are not suffering the pains of
hell, that we have hopes of heaven and
ever shall be there, we owe not to our
good works, but to God&#8217;s good will; to
that only. Till converted, man does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
desire this good will; and never deserves
it. We have no claim to it whatever. It
is &ldquo;not by works of righteousness which
we have done, but according to his mercy
God saves us, by the washing of regeneration
and the renewing of the Holy Ghost&rdquo;&mdash;therefore
His good will has no root in
any good works of ours. A sacred mystery,
we may apply to it the words which
Job, contemplating the grand mysteries of
nature, applied to our earth when, seeing
this great globe floating in ethereal space,
sustained by no pillars, nor suspended by
any chain that linked it to the skies, he
said, Thou hast hung it upon nothing!</p>

<h2>XII.</h2>

<h3>THE PERSON WHO EXPRESSES &ldquo;GOOD
WILL.&rdquo;</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he person is God&mdash;He who
spake by holy men of old,
speaking here by the lips of
angels. Where there is a will,
there is a way, is a brave and admirable
proverb. Yet, though comparatively true
in most cases, to some it is altogether
inapplicable. Look, for example, at the
women who, when the men had turned
cowards, boldly follow our Lord to Calvary,
bewailing and lamenting Him!
What tears they shed, what a wail they
raise, when the door opens, and, surrounded
by armed guards, Jesus comes
forth from the Judgment Hall, bleeding,
bound, crowned with thorns. When He
sank down on the street under the weight
of the cross, and His blessed head lay low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in the dust, had there been a chance of
saving Him, how had they rushed to His
help; and, giving their naked breasts to
the Roman spears, burst through the circle
to rescue Him; to die with Him rather
than desert Him. But they were helpless.
Their good will availed the loved object
nothing&mdash;beyond this, that the sympathy
flowing in their tears and expressed in
their looks, somewhat soothed the sorrows
of His heart, and fell like balm drops on
His smarting wounds.</p>

<p>Again, what good will did David bear
to Jonathan! Did Jonathan love David
as his own soul? and under circumstances
calculated to dissolve all common friendships,
and work such change on the heart
as wine suffers when it turns into vinegar,
did Jonathan&#8217;s sentiments continue unchanged,
his affection unabated to the
last? His love was strong as death; many
waters could not quench it. But it was
amply requited. David proved that with
his harp; had he been present on that
fatal field where the bow of Jonathan was
broken, he had proved it with his sword.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
With what a lion spring had he answered
Jonathan&#8217;s cry for help; how had he bestrode
his fallen friend, covering him with
his battered shield; mowing a way through
the ranks of the Philistines, how had he
borne him off to a place of safety, or falling
in the attempt, left others to compose
their elegy, and sing, They were pleasant
in their lives, and in death they were not
divided! God is a very present help in
time of trouble; but there was no help for
Jonathan in David. Far away from that
bloody field, his good will availed Jonathan
nothing&mdash;beyond embalming his rare
virtues in immortal song, and in an imperishable
lament raising an imperishable
monument to the memory of a man whose
love to him was wonderful, passing the
love of women.</p>

<p>Again, what good will in his father&#8217;s
heart to Esau? But the old man&#8217;s hands
are tied. Fresh from the chase, and
ignorant of what has happened in his
absence, Esau approaches Isaac, saying,
Let my father arise and eat of his son&#8217;s
venison, that thy soul may bless me!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Who art thou? says the blind old man&mdash;astonished
that any should ask what he
has already given away. Recognising the
beloved voice which replied, I am thy
son, thy first-born Esau, and dreading
some dire calamity, Isaac trembled exceedingly,
crying, &ldquo;Who? where is he
that hath taken venison and brought it
me; and I have eaten of all before thou
camest, and have blessed him? yea, and
he shall be blessed.&rdquo; By the basest,
cruelest fraud, Jacob has possessed himself
of the blessing; and if their mother,
his own partner in guilt, was watching the
issue of this perfidious plot, how had it
pierced her heart to hear Esau, when the
truth flashed on his mind and he saw the
treasure stolen, cry, &ldquo;with a great and
exceeding bitter cry, Bless me, even me
also, O my father!&rdquo; The strong man,
the bold hardy hunter, lifted up his voice
and wept; seeking repentance, as the
apostle says&mdash;to get Isaac to undo the
deed&mdash;with tears but found it not. What
availed his father&#8217;s good will to him, his
favourite son? What was done must stand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
The blessing was gone; and Isaac, though
he had the will, had no way to recall it.</p>

<p>But what need to ransack old history
for examples? How often have our hearts
overflowed with good will, yet we could
only weep with them that wept&mdash;pity
sorrows we could not soothe, wants we
were powerless to relieve? Tears we
might give, but they could not clothe the
naked, or feed the hungry, or save the
dying, or recall the dead, or close the
wounds which death had made. In
dying chambers how are we made painfully,
bitterly to feel that man&#8217;s power is
not commensurate with his will? What
good will, what tender affection toward
some dear, beloved object! yet, as we
hung over the dying couch, all we could
do was to moisten the speechless lips, to
wipe the clammy sweat from death&#8217;s cold
brow and watch the sinking pulses of life&#8217;s
ebbing tide. What would we not have
done to meet the wishes of the eye that,
when speech was gone, turned on us
imploring, never-to-be-forgotten looks!
Alas, our good will availed them nothing!</p>

Such recollections, by the contrast
which they present to God&#8217;s good will,
greatly enhance its preciousness. &ldquo;His
favour is life, his loving-kindness is better
than life.&rdquo; Where God has a will, God
always has a way. At the throne of divine
grace, none had ever to shed Esau&#8217;s tears,
or cry with him, Hast thou but one
blessing, O my father? Our father in
heaven is affluent in blessings, plenteous in
redemption, abundant in goodness and in
truth. Who ever turned an imploring eye
on God, and brought to prayer the earnestness
of him that bends the knee to yon
blind old man, but became in time the
happy object of God&#8217;s loving, saving mercy.
Let men trust in the Lord. In the name
of Christ let them throw themselves on
His mercy. What though they cannot
see it? It is around them, like the invisible
but ambient air on which the eagle,
with an awful gulf below, throws herself
from her rocky nest in fearless freedom,
and with expanded wings. So let men,
trusting in God&#8217;s faithful word, spread out
the wings of faith, and cast them on His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
good will. Wrapping the world round in
an atmosphere of mercy, it shall sustain
their weight, and bear them aloft, till,
ascending into the calm regions of Christian
hope, they bathe their eyes in the
beams of the Sun of Righteousness, and
feel their feet firmly planted on the Rock
of Ages.</p>

<p>But let one thing be remembered, this,
namely, that God will not save any against
their will. Let us therefore seek, and seek
till we obtain, a change of heart. He
draws, not drives&mdash;will not force any into
heaven&mdash;nor be served by the hands of a
slave. If I would not have a sullen,
crouching slave wait at my table, work in
my house, stand in my poor presence,
much less He who says, Give me thy
heart, my son! He makes His people
willing in the day of His power. Softened
in the flames of Divine love, their stubborn
wills yield to His, and, under the hand of
His Holy Spirit and the hammer of His
mighty word, take the fashion and form
of His own. Thus, His will and their
wills being brought into perfect harmony,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
His people feel their duty to be their
delight, and regard His holy service as no
irksome bondage, but the truest liberty
and highest honour.</p>
